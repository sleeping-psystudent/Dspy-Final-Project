## Motivation
This repository serves as our final project for [Introduction to programming for data science](https://lopentu.github.io/dspy2023/).

In recent years, the K-pop phenomenon has swept across the globe. However, besides the well-known top-tier groups, numerous small and mid-sized groups emerge annually, facing intense competition. How to carve a path to success amid this fierce competition remains a constant topic of discussion. This research project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, supplemented by data such as views, likes, comments, and more gathered through web scraping on YouTube. The aim is to outline, in simple terms, the key elements contributing to the success of a South Korean musical group.
